The first version of Squeak was released in 1996 at Apple Computer. It is a direct descendant of Smalltalk-80. While Squeak still supports the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, its preferred UI framework is Morphic, which has been derived from the framework of the same name developed for Self. Squeak is a self-supporting system that allows to generate new virtual machines mostly from Smalltalk code.
