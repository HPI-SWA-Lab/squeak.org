<a href="https://github.com/codefrau/plopp">Plopp</a> allows children to create 3D worlds without using complex 3D modelling techniques. Regular 2D paintings are inflated (thus the name Plopp). The 3D objects can then be moved, rotated, or scaled. Children can paint their own floor and background and also adjust the lighting.
