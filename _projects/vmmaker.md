The framework for creating the virtual machine.  This is a Smalltalk program called the simulator that is used to develop the VM using the full power of the IDE, and a Smalltalk-to-C or Smalltalk-to-JavaScript translator that produces the sources for the production VM.  So even the VM is implemented in Smalltalk!
