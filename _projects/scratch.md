Scratch lets you build programs like you build Lego(tm) - stacking blocks together. It helps you learn to think in a creative fashion, understand logic, and build fun projects. Scratch is pre-installed in the [current Raspbian image for the Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/courses/learn-scratch){:target=_blank}.
