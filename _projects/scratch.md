Create and share stories, games, and animations with Scratch. It helps young people to think in a creative fashion, conclude logically, and work together. Scratch is pre-installed in the [current Raspbian image for the Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-scratch/){:target=_blank}.
