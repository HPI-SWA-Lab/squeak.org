Everything is an object. Objects collaborate by exchanging messages to achieve the desired application behavior. The Smalltalk programming language has a concise syntax and simple execution semantics. The Smalltalk system is implemented in itself: The compiler, debugger, programming tools, and so on are all Smalltalk code the user can read and modify. Novice programmers can get started easily and experts can engineer elegant solutions at large.
