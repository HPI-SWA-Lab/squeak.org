## The Mission

The Squeak Oversight Board coordinates the community’s open-source development of its versatile Smalltalk environment.

To that end, we are increasing our visibility within the community through better communication, improving the release process, joining the Software Freedom Conservancy, enabling Teams to achieve their tasks, and integrating contributions from collaborating groups (for example, Pharo, Etoys, and Croquet).

{::comment}
Our goals for this year are a clear release process for the 3.x series, a license-clean Squeak 4.0 release, a solid legal foundation, and a draft programming interface for exchanging code between systems.  With these, we believe the community will be more effective in developing for itself and in introducing the system to newcomers.
