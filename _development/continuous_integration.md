Travis CI is a continuous integration service that you can use to build and test
your projects on [GitHub][github]{:target="_blank"}.
Since Squeak/Smalltalk is a [supported language on Travis CI][travis_docs]{:target="_blank"},
it is easy to activate testing for your projects using the
[smalltalkCI][smalltalkci]{:target="_blank"} framework.
