A family of virtual machines that supports Smalltalk and other languages of
the Smalltalk family, including the standard VM for Squeak, Pharo and Newspeak.
Just-in-time compilation, stack-to-register mapping, and aggressive in-line
message caching yield efficiency in executing Smalltalk byte code. Being a
fork of VMMaker, OpenSmalltalk VMs provide safe incremental development of JIT
VMs.
